# PQFile System - Comprehensive Technical Overview

## Executive Summary

PQFile is a post-quantum cryptography document encryption system built on AWS Lambda, PostgreSQL, and Docker. The system automatically encrypts documents uploaded to S3 using a hybrid cryptographic approach that combines Kyber768 Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) with AES-256-CBC symmetric encryption. This architecture provides quantum-resistant security while maintaining high performance and scalability.

## System Architecture Overview

The PQFile system operates as an event-driven serverless architecture with the following core components:

1. **S3 Storage Layer**: Two buckets handle document lifecycle - uploads/ for incoming documents and encrypted/ for processed documents
2. **Lambda Processing Layer**: Two functions handle encryption (store_lambda) and decryption (retrieve_lambda)
3. **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL manages encryption keys, metadata, and audit trails
4. **Security Layer**: AWS KMS provides additional key protection and management
5. **Development Environment**: Docker containers provide LocalStack and PostgreSQL for local development

## Document Processing Workflow

### Upload and Encryption Process

When a user uploads a document to the S3 uploads/ bucket, the following automated process occurs:

1. **S3 Event Trigger**: The upload automatically generates an S3 event notification
2. **Lambda Invocation**: The S3 event triggers the store_lambda function
3. **Document Retrieval**: store_lambda downloads the document from S3
4. **Key Selection**: The system selects an active encryption key from the database pool
5. **Cryptographic Processing**: The document undergoes hybrid encryption using Kyber768 + AES-256-CBC
6. **Encrypted Storage**: The encrypted package is stored in the S3 encrypted/ bucket
7. **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged to the database for compliance and monitoring

### Decryption and Retrieval Process

When a user requests document decryption, the following process occurs:

1. **Direct Invocation**: The retrieve_lambda function is called with an encrypted package
2. **Key Retrieval**: The system fetches the corresponding private key from the database
3. **Decryption Process**: The encrypted package is decrypted using the stored private key
4. **Content Return**: The original document content is returned to the user
5. **Access Logging**: The decryption operation is logged for audit purposes

## Cryptographic Implementation

### Hybrid Encryption Approach

The system uses a hybrid cryptographic approach that combines post-quantum and classical cryptography:

**Key Encapsulation Mechanism (Kyber768)**:
- Public Key Size: 1,184 bytes
- Private Key Size: 2,400 bytes
- Ciphertext Size: 1,088 bytes
- Shared Secret: 32 bytes
- Security Level: NIST Level 3 (equivalent to AES-192)

**Symmetric Encryption (AES-256-CBC)**:
- Key Size: 256 bits (32 bytes)
- Block Size: 128 bits (16 bytes)
- Initialization Vector: 16 random bytes per encryption
- Padding: PKCS7 standard

### Encryption Process Detail

1. **Key Generation**: Generate Kyber768 key pair (public_key, private_key)
2. **Encapsulation**: Use public key to generate (ciphertext, shared_secret)
3. **Key Derivation**: Derive AES key using SHA-256(shared_secret)
4. **Document Encryption**: Encrypt document using AES-256-CBC with random IV
5. **Package Creation**: Combine key_id, ciphertext, IV, encrypted_data, and metadata

### Decryption Process Detail

1. **Package Parsing**: Extract components from encrypted package
2. **Key Retrieval**: Fetch private key from database using key_id
3. **Decapsulation**: Recover shared_secret using Kyber768.decapsulate(ciphertext, private_key)
4. **Key Derivation**: Derive AES key using SHA-256(shared_secret)
5. **Document Decryption**: Decrypt using AES-256-CBC with stored IV

## Database Architecture

### Core Tables

**encryption_keys Table**:
- Stores Kyber768 key pairs and lifecycle information
- Tracks usage count for load balancing across key pool
- Manages key status (active, rotation_queued, expired, revoked)
- Links to AWS KMS for additional security layer

**access_logs Table**:
- Comprehensive audit trail for all document operations
- Records encryption, decryption, and access events
- Tracks timestamps, user information, and operation types
- Links to encryption keys for complete traceability

**key_rotations Table**:
- Manages key rotation processes and schedules
- Tracks old and new key relationships during rotation
- Monitors rotation status and completion timestamps

### Key Management Strategy

The system maintains a pool of approximately 100 active encryption keys with the following characteristics:

- **Load Balancing**: Keys are selected based on usage count to distribute load evenly
- **Automatic Generation**: New keys are created when the pool falls below threshold
- **Rotation Schedule**: Keys older than 30 days are queued for rotation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Old keys remain available for decryption during rotation
